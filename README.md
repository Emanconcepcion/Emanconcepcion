### âš¡ Fun fact: I am a car enthusiast. I find enjoyment in working on cars and building them to their full potential. Being behind a vehicle enables me to explore countless places, giving me a sense of freedom and peace of mind. Currently, I have a 2019 Genesis G70 which I am further working on to achieve street/race specifications. There are already modifications made to this vehicle of mine, but it is not near completion since I am quite detail oriented for ideal results.
